# About

This project is an implementation of the streaming, one-pass histograms described in Ben-Haim's [Streaming Parallel Decision Trees](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v11/ben-haim10a.html). It also includes the extensions added by Tyree's [Parallel Boosted Regression Trees](http://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~tyrees/Publications_files/fr819-tyreeA.pdf).

The histograms act as an approximation of the underlying dataset.  They can be used for visualization, discretization, or analysis.  This includes finding the median or any other percentile in one pass.  The histograms may be built independently and combined, making them a good fit for map-reduce algorithms.

# Building

1. Install [maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
2. Make sure you have Java 1.6
3. Checkout the histogram project using Git
4. Run `mvn clean install`

# Example

```java
long pointCount = 100000;
int histogramBins = 100;
Random random = new Random();
Histogram hist = new Histogram(histogramBins);

for (long i = 0; i < pointCount; i++) {
  hist.insert(random.nextGaussian());
}

//the sum at 0 should be about 50000
double sum = hist.sum(0);

//the split point between two uniform (by population) bins should be about 0
//this is an approximate median
double split = hist.uniform(2).get(0);
```
